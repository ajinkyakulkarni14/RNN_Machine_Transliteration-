# Devanagari Machine Transliteration using Recurrent Neural Network

#Introduction
The Machine transliteration task is to transducer which provide phonetic translation 
across the different scripts. Here, We provided the Latin - Devanagari phonetic transducer
with Recurrent Neural Network - Long short term memory, as a Sequence learning approach.
e.g : Input  : Good Morning
      Output : गुड मॉर्निंग
